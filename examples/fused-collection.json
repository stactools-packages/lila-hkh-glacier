    "description": "Each fused image is a spatial area measuring roughly 6km x 7.5km (with definitions that roughly match up with USGS quarter quadrangles). Each fused image comes with one corresponding GeoTIFF file. The entire glacier mapping dataset contains 35 tiles from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal, and Pakistan. Each GeoTIFF tile consists of 15 channels. All channels are aligned at 30m spatial resolution. Elevation and slope channels were upsampled from 90m to 30m resolution.",
